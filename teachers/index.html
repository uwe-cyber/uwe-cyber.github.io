						<h2>Cyber Security Education Workshops for Teachers (November 2022 - February 2023)</h2>
						
					</header>
					<div id="about">

					<p>UWEcyber are delighted to offer school teachers the opportunity to attend a series of Cyber Security Education workshops in the 2022/2023 academic year. We will be hosting workshops both at UWE Bristol (Frenchay campus), as well as at our FE partner, Gloucestershire College (Cheltenham campus), to maximise the opportunity to schools across the West of England region. This is the second year that we have been able to offer this to our wider education community, with the generous support of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).</p>

					<p>The workshops are designed to help educators reflect on how they are teaching cyber security in schools, and how they can develop practical hands-on experiments that they could run in their classrooms. UWE academics will help upskill teachers on related cyber security topics and help them to curate activities they can deliver in the classroom.</p>

					<p>You would be required to attend in-person for 3 full-day workshops, starting from November 2022. We are able to provide schools with funding to facilitate supply teacher cover so that teachers can attend all three events.</p>
					<p>Participants of the workshop will work towards the development of classroom activities for teaching cyber security, that will be showcased as part of an event to be held with UWE and NCSC later in the year. Workshop themes will include cyber security basics, practical cyber security lessons, and cyber security careers, degrees and apprenticeships, as well as subjects identified by the participants. Participants will also need to consider how they can share their learning outcomes with other colleagues in their school, in the interest of upskilling and improving cyber security in schools.</p>

							<h2>Cyber Security Education Workshops for Teachers (January 2022 - March 2022)</h2>
							
						</header>
						<div id="about">

						<p>In Spring 2022, UWEcyber hosted a series of workshops for school teachers in the West of England region. The purpose of the workshops was to help teachers in the region to develop their knowledge and understanding around cyber security, and specifically, to discuss and facilitate teachers in developing their own practical teaching resources to help support their delivery of the cyber security schools curriculum. Workshop attendees have developed a range of practical-based lesson plans, ranging from penetration testing using the OWASP Juice Shop, developing a cyber range for attack and defence, machine learning for identifying suspicious phishing emails, and online Open Source Intelligence challenges for identifying suspicious user activities.

<br /><br />The following schools in the West of England region have taken part in the on-site workshops: Bristol Grammar School, Cotham School, City of Bristol College, St Bede's Catholic College, Brimsham Green School, Badminton School, The Crypt Grammar School (Gloucester), Chilton Trinity School (Bridgewater). The workshop was open to all schools in the region, with supply teacher costs funded by the project.</p>
